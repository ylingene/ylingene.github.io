This was my first time traveling to Japan. It was a 10 day trip split between Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and Nara.

Even though I had just missed the cherry blossom season by a few weeks, the foliage in the places I visited were just
as beautiful. Highlights of this trip were waking up early to explore at sunrise and having a kawadoko dinner over the
Kibune-gawa river near Kyoto.
